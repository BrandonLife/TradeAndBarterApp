    <h2 className="info">Trade and Barter is the next phase of economical exchange.  We are in a time where many are looking to alternative means of exchange as a source of provision.  We may not always have the cash that we need but we always have something to trade or barter for what we need.  No matter if its a skill, a homemade piece of equipment or clothing, precious metals or simple food and water, our resources are our way forward.  We can be our own middlemen on our way to prosperity.  This was once the way, and again we have returned to the path of the ancient and traditional.  Welcome traders!</h2>
